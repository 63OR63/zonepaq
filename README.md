## FAQ

- ### What are `.pak` files in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2?

`.pak` files are archives that contain game assets, mods, or configuration files used in **S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2** and other Unreal Engine games.

- ### Where are `.pak` files located?

The default location for **S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2** is `%GAME_FOLDER%\Stalker2\Content\Paks`.

- ### What is the order `.pak` mods are loaded?

The order in which `.pak` files are loaded depends on their names. Files that come later alphabetically have higher priority. For example, `zzz_mod.pak` will override `z_mod.pak`.

If `zzz_mod.pak` contains `file1.cfg` and `z_mod.pak` contains both `file1.cfg` and `file2.cfg`, then only `file1.cfg` will be replaced, while `file2.cfg` will remain unchanged.

Additionally, if you add `_P` at the end of a `.pak` file's name, it will have even higher priority and override files in mods without this special suffix.

- ### Should I keep original mods after creating a merged one?

Typically, you copy the merged mod and delete the original mods it was merged from. However, mods often contain multiple files â€” some conflicting and others not. If you're unsure what you're doing, a more dirty yet robust approach is to rename the merged mod to something like `zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz_merged_P.pak` so it loads last and overwrites any conflicts, and can keep all the original mods in place.

- ### How does the merging in **ZonePaq Toolkit** works?

**ZonePaq Toolkit** uses a combination of **[repak_cli](https://github.com/trumank/repak)** and file comparison tools to compare files from multiple `.pak` archives. It highlights conflicting files and allows you to merge them into a single merged mod.

- ### Can I repack my mods after editing?

Yes! The **ZonePaq Toolkit** module will automatically repack files into a `.pak` archive after merging. Also, you can manually repack any folders.

- ### What external tools are supported for merging conflicts?

Currently, **[KDiff3](https://kdiff3.sourceforge.net)** and **[WinMerge](https://winmerge.org)** are supported.

- ### Can this Toolkit be used for other Unreal Engine games?

Theoretically, yes. You can try and leave your feedback.

- ### Is the ZonePaq Toolkit free?

Yes, this tool is completely free and open source under the MIT License.
